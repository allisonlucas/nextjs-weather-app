## Next.js Weather App

This project was created using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs#how-to-use).

It is a very simple application that shows today's hourly weather forecast using the National Weather Service API. The app leverages the built-in client-side routing using the [Link](https://nextjs.org/docs#routing) that next.js provides. It also takes advantage of the built-in [styled-jsx](https://nextjs.org/docs#css) to add css styles to the body component without needing to create a separate css file. The application uses the [Victory charting library](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/) to show the weather data.

### Run the App

#### `npm install`

then run:
